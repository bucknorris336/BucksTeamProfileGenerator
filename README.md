## Description

```
I created a command-line application that accepts user input infromation. The application will prompt the user for information about the employee and then for information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be any combination of manager, engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
```

Name
